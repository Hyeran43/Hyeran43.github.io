I'm an ambitious and dedicated graduate student with a strong passion for research. At the same time, I've come to realize that being too fixated on details and not taking breaks can stifle creativity, lead to biases in decision-making, and ultimately lead to burnout. That's why I believe it's crucial to balance intense focus with moments of relaxation and reflection. Having a hobby is one way I achieve that balance, and for me, that hobby is **powerlifting**.

Since I started powerlifting in the spring of 2022, I've been amazed at how much stronger I'm getting every day. It's not a matter of luck; it's a result of the effort I put in. Keeping track of my progress by taking videos of every session and seeking feedback from my coach has been a valuable learning experience.

But I don't limit myself to just one activity. I enjoy exploring different hobbies, such as visiting drawing cafes where I can mix colors and create new shades.

I've also taken classes on making coffee cocktails.

As a tea & coffee & taste enthusiast, I'm always eager to try new drinks or cuisine.

Ultimately, I believe that having a hobby is an essential part of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. It allows me to step back, recharge, and return to my research with renewed energy and creativity.
