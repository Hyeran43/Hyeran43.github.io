Neural Representations in MPFC and insula encode individual differences in estimating others' preferences

Suppose you're having a dinner with date or business partner to whom you might wanna give nice impression.
The only information you have about him(her or they) is the picture of their face.
Can you precisely guess what this specific person would favor?

Such ability to accurately estimate others' favors is vital for interpersonal skills that leads to successful social life.
Commonly, we guess close ones' preferences based on past experiences - whether my friend would be delighted if she opens my gift or whether my parents would be happy if I reserve unfamiliar restaurants.
However, not only close ones, we even sometimes have to guess unknown people's tastes for diverse types of things.
And previous studies have reported that just with a brief exposure to stranger's appearances, people can infer various information such as personality, socioeconomic status, preferences and more.

Accuracy of estimating preferences of others has been conducted in Kang et al.(2013), using univariate approach.
Recently, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) has been suggested as more robust approach to investigate individual differences.
Hence, our study aimed to
