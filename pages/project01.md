Negative Pay-It-Forward Reciprocity in Hierarchical Situations
=====
*Keyword: Unfairness, Hierarchy, Pay-It-Forward Reciprocity, Dictator Game, Power Dynamics*

The concept of 'pay-it-forward reciprocity' describes the phenomenon where an act of kindness offered by one person to another can lead to a chain of similar actions being perpetuated among different individuals. This principle of reciprocation, which is often summarized as "You scratch my back and I'll scratch someone else's," has been shown to promote cooperation and contribute to the foundation of society. However, **the principle of reciprocity also applies to negative actions, whereby negative behaviors can be passed from one person to another in a similar chain**. The spread of unfairness or selfishness has been actively studied for a long time, revealing that negative pay-it-forward reciprocity is also quite pervasive. 

The question arises as to whether **hierarchy(or ranking)** influences the spread of negativity. Using **modified sequential dictator game**, we found that people do not pass on negativity equally to those of different rankings. Despite being negatively biased due to unequal treatment from a previous partner, then interacting with different partners, participants only treated those with a lower ranking unfairly. Conversely, they were more likely to treat those with a higher ranking positively in the same situation.

This suggests that the spread of unfairness is more severe in fields with hierarchical structures or power dynamics. For instance, the nursing field has long struggled with this issue, commonly known as "**Taeoom**"(meaning 'burn to ashes') in Korea and "**Horizontal Violence**" in Western countries. Especially in Korea, negative pay-it-forward reciprocity in hierarchical situation is termed as "**Daemullim**". Despite attempts to address this problem, efforts to break the chain of passing down unfairness have failed for centuries.

Our study provides empirical evidence of negative pay-it-forward reciprocity in hierarchical situations and highlights the impact of individual traits on the perpetuation of such behavior. The implications of our findings extend beyond academia and offer policy insight to break out of this vicious circle, ultimately promoting a fair and just society.
