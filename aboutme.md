Welcome, I'm Hyeran Kang. 

- I am a graduate student in [Laboratory of Social Decision Neuroscience](http://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/) (PI: Hackjin Kim) at Korea University.
- **Decision-Making**, **Perspective Taking**, **Empathy**, **Interoception**, **Social Comparison**, **Hierarchy**, **Self-concept**, **Consumer Behavior** are the topics of my interest.
- In our world, each individual is unique, which can lead to conflicts due to differing perspectives, but also enriches our world with the beauty of diversity. 
- Although we all live in the same world, each person's experiences shape their own distinct reality, influencing the decisions they make on a daily basis.
- Using **fMRI**, I seek to better understand **individual differences** underlying Self-Concept or Social Cognition such as ToM, Empathy, Social Comparison.
- Some people are better at taking others' perspectives while others  aren't.
- Some people are sensitive to hierarchy(or ranking), while others aren't.
- Some people are adept in recognizing one's own internal state, while others aren't.
- What centers in such differences? Which personal traits or **neural mechanisms** explain such pheonomenon?


### Outside of the lab, I love:
- Tasting something I've never tasted before (Recently, I visited Cuba Cuisine Restaurant in NY - which was awesome)
- Shopping new ingredients or spices (Olive oil, Balsamic Vinegar, Coffee, even Water from different brands)
- Willpower comes from Power! **Powerlifting** (SQ: 95kg, BP: 50kg, DL: 105kg, Total: 250kg)
