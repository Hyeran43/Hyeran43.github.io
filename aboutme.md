Welcome, I'm Hyeran Kang. 

- I am a graduate student in [Laboratory of Social Decision Neuroscience](http://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/) (PI: Hackjin Kim) in Korea University.
- **Perspective Taking**, **Empathy**, **Anti-social behavior**, **Interoception**, **Social Comparison**, **Hierarchy**, **Self-concept** are the topics of my interest.
- We live in the world where each individual is different in one's own way, which engenders conflicts evoked from different perspectives but also blossoms our world with the beauty of diversity.
- It's quite important to note that we are all unique and one in a million, valuing diversity while rejecting conformity.
- Using **fMRI**, I seek to better understand **individual differences** underlying social cognition such as ToM, Empathy, Social Comparison or self-concept.
- Some people are good at taking others' stance while some aren't.
- Some people are sensitive to hierarchy(or ranking), while some aren't.
- Some people are adept in recognizing one's own internal state, while some aren't.
- What centers in such differences? Which personal traits or **neural mechanisms** explain such pheonomenon?


### Outside the lab, I love:
- Tasting something I've never tasted before (Recently, I visited Cuba Cuisine Restaurant in NY - which was awesome)
- Shopping new ingredients or species (Olive oil, Balsamic Vinegar, Coffee, even Water from different brands)
- Willpower comes from Power! **Powerlifting** (SQ: 85kg, BP: 50kg, DL: 100kg, Total: 235kg)
