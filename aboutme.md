Welcome, I'm Hyeran Kang. 

- I am a researcher in [Laboratory of Social and Decision Neuroscience](http://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/) (PI: Hackjin Kim) at Korea University.
- **Social Neuroscience**, **Decision-Making**, **Bias**, **Self**, **Emotion**, **Group Dynamics**, **Antisocial Behavior**, **Information-Seeking**, **Interoception**,& **Consumer Behavior** are the topics of my interest.
- In our world, each individual is unique, which can lead to conflicts due to differing perspectives, but also enriches our world with the beauty of diversity. 
- Although we all live in the same world, each person's experiences shape their own distinct reality, influencing the decisions they make on a daily basis.
- Using **fMRI** and **Computational Modeling**, I seek to better understand **individual differences** underlying self-concept, value computation, or social cognition such as ToM, Empathy, Social Comparison.
- Some people are better at taking others' perspectives while others  aren't.
- Some are adept in recognizing one's own internal state, while others aren't.
- Some value present states over future states, while others put more weight on the latter.
- Some are sensitive to hierarchy(or ranking), while others aren't.
- What centers in such differences? Which **personal traits** or **neural mechanisms** explain such pheonomenon?


### Outside of the lab, I love:
- Tasting something I've never tasted before (Recently, I visited Cuba Cuisine Restaurant in NY - which was awesome)
- Shopping new ingredients or spices (Olive oil, Balsamic Vinegar, Coffee, even Water from different brands)
- Willpower comes from Power! **Powerlifting** (SQ: 95kg, BP: 50kg, DL: 105kg, Total: 250kg)
